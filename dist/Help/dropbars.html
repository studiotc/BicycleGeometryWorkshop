	<h1>Drop Bar</h1>
	
	<p>
	
	The drop bars are designed to emulate the hand positions of standard drop bars.  They can be specified with a straight ramp for the top (hood) portion and with a straight grip section in the drops also.   The handlebars use a simple curve if these straight sections are not used.  The drop bars specify four hand points: A,B,C, and D.  HandPointA is the center grip position at the stem.  HandPointB is the typical hood position.  HandPointC is the drop position.  HandPointD is on the extension.

	<h3>MountingAngle</h3>
	<p>
	This is mounting angle of the drop bar.
	</P>
	
	<h3>Reach</h3>
	<p>
	This is distance from the mounting point to the bar centerline at it's furthest reach.
	</P>

	<h3>Drop</h3>
	<p>
	This is distance from the mounting point to the bar centerline at it's lowest drop.
	</P>
	
	<h3>Extension</h3>
	<p>
	This is length of extension from the end of the bar.  The extension is a straight section parallel to the ground when mounted at zero degrees.
	</P>	
	
	<h3>RampAngle</h3>
	<p>
	This is angle of the ramp of the handlebar.
	</P>
	<h3>RampLength</h3>
	<p>
	This is length of the ramp of the handlebar. The handlebar is curved to it's midpoint after the ramp.
	</P>
	
	<h3>DropAngle</h3>
	<p>
	This is angle of the straight grip section in the drop of the handlebar.
	</P>
	<h3>DropLength</h3>
	<p>
	This is length of the straight grip section in the drop of the handlebar. The handlebar is curved to it's midpoint after this section.
	</P>	
	
	<h3>CenterHeight</h3>
	<p>
	This is height above the center of the bar for HandPointA.
	</P>	

	<h3>HoodT</h3>
	<p>
	This is a scale value that determines the placement of HandPointB on the hoods.  A value of zero will place the hand at the begining of the bar and a value of one will put the point at the midpoint of the bar.  If there is a ramp section, 0 to 0.5 will put the handpoint on the ramp, and 0.5 to 1.0 will put the handpoint in the curved portion.
	</P>

	<h3>DropT</h3>
	<p>
	This is a scale value that determines the placement of HandPointC in the drops.  A value of zero will place the hand at the midpoint of the bar and a value of one will put the point at the end of the bar (before the extension).  If there is a straight grip section, the handpoint is placed on this section according to the T value.
	</P>

	<h3>ExtensionT</h3>
	<p>
	This is a scale value that determines the placement of HandPointD on the extension.  A value of zero will place the hand at the begining of the extension and a value of one will put the point at the end of the extension. 
	</P>
