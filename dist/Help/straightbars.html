	<h1>Straight Bar</h1>
	
	<p>
	
	The straight bar is designed to emulate a simple straight handlebar or a handbar with a single bend.  There is only one hand placement provided with the straight bar.  The hand placement is a projection of the grip on the bar.  A front view is provided for reference.

	<h3>GripOffset</h3>
	<p>
	This is distance from the center of the bar to the grasping point at the palm of the hand.
